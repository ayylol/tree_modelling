TODO:
- Finish grid implementation
- Start on voxel automata for skeleton
- Start on voxel automata for tree strands
- Rendering

less important:
- better folder structure

NOTES:
- I don't think that the parser is very flexible 
- (what if a tree immediately splits off into multiple segments, then the root idea doesnt work)
